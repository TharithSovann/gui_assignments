Date created: 11/13/20

I had a lot of help from:
jqueryvalidation.org helped tremendously with the jquery validation even though it was down sometimes,
W3Schools for html, css and javascript help,
StackOverflow for debugging,
youtube...a lot of youtube tutorials

For this assignment, I enhanced my hw5 with jquery validations. However, I wasn't able to get the live error message to pop up as I type into the field. 
It will pop up after I move on to the next field, which isn't so bad. It was very confusing and I had a lot of trouble implementing the jquery validator
into my program. In the end, the jquery validator works and everything is functioning fine. It could use a bit more CSS to make it look better but
since I'm turning this in sort of late, I'll leave it for another time. An example of this is like the error message pushing the form field slightly to 
the left.
