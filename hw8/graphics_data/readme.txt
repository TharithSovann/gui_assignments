My scrabble functions perfectly as it is supposed to. The only feature that it is missing is the prevention of putting un-adjacent tiles. I didn't do it
because the late penalty was not worth it. Other than that, the program randomly selects tiles out of the bag, creates an <img> out of it and put it onto
the rack. Users can drag it around but can't drop it anywhere but the board slots, after which it won't be able to be dragged anymore (just like the
requirement says). After the submit button is pressed, the indicator for the score and tiles left in the bag will be updated. The tiles rack will be 
repopulated until there are 7 tiles again. If there aren't enough tiles left in the bag, it'll just refill as much as it can. I have two double letter
slots on the board and it doubles the value of the letter to be added to the total score. The user can also restart the game whenever they want. This 
results in a brand new 7 tile rack, the score and the bag will reset.Overall, everything works as it should.
