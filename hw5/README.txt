I had a lot of help from:

StackOverflow for debugging javascript

For this assignment, I created a dynamic multiplication table that utilizes javascript in conjunction with html and css. This is my first real experience 
fully using html and javascript in conjunction. In order to create the user depended multiplication table, I must be able to read in user input. I didn't
know how to do that using html and javascript at the beginning but the resources provided on top of some more W3Schools definitely helped. The way html
calls functions from the javascript file through button clicks is surprisingly intuitive and simple. I began with making a simple form containing divs 
with labels and inputs, it this I was able to give an id to each field that will handle user inputs. After looking at some of the class resources and 
some googling, I found the onclick function for the submit button. With this, I was able to relay all the information into my javascript file where I just
coded the program fairly ordinarily. At first I used some alert boxes and error boxes to make sure that the inputs are being transferred properly. After 
that was done, I skipped the error handling and got my pen and paper out. I've worked with similar problems like this in pass CS classes so it wasn't 
too tricky. The hardest part was getting the hang of using <tr> and <td> for my rows and columns, that was a bit weird in the beginning. Besides that, it
just took some visual trial and error. For error handling, I made error boxes for when error messages needed to be displayed. I made errors concerning
cases when letters are inputted, minimum values being greater than maximum values and values that were out of the boundary of -100 to 100. I prompted this
boundary at top of the website as well. It doesn't look too bad right now but it could look better. Since I will be working with this in the future 
assignment(s), I will leave the further customization for the future.
