For this assignment, I enhanced my hw6 with jquery widgets. The two widgets I was supposed to integrate were the sliders and the tabs. I was able to 
successfully integrate the sliders. However, I couldn't get the tabs to work. I created a copy of my hw7 with the working sliders and began working on 
my tabs. However, I just couldn't figure out how to get them to show up. Some of the problems I had were the Jquery min js cdn was having mismatched 
attributes (the tabs) with the ui min js. I fixed this with a newer version of jquery min js but that brought on more problems. At one point, I thought
the tabs worked but I couldn't get my table to be linked with the different tabs and only the latest table was showing. In the end, I just reverted back
to my hw7 version with the sliders working.
